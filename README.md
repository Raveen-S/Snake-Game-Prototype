# Snake-Game-Prototype
A modern take on the classic Snake Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Unlike traditional versions, this game introduces a twist: the snake doesn't grow when it eats the eggs. Instead, the challenge increases as the snakeâ€™s speed ramps up the longer you play!

ðŸŽ® Features:

Square Snake and Eggs: The snake and eggs are represented by squares for a clean, retro look.

Speed Increases Over Time: As you collect more eggs, the snakeâ€™s speed increases, making the game progressively more challenging.

Responsive Design: Fully functional on both desktop and mobile devices.

Simple Yet Addictive: The game is easy to play but difficult to master as the speed continues to increase.


ðŸ›  Technologies Used:

HTML5: For the structure and layout of the game interface.

CSS3: Styling the game with a simple, minimalistic design.

JavaScript (ES6): Implements the game logic, controls, and increasing speed feature.
